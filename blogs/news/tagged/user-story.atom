I set the LaserPecker 2 up on the kitchen table, since I was making dinner, and handed her my phone. She googled a picture of stars and picked the font. Using another app I did a quick design and loaded it in the LaserPecker app. She helped me line up the preview to where she wanted her engraving. We let it do its thing. It looked so cool and she loved it. Then we packed it back up and set the table!</span></p>

<h3>How did you get to start your own laser business?</h3>
<p>We were backers of the Indiegogo campaign for the <a href="https://bit.ly/3HTgoym" target="_blank" title="LaserPecker 1 pro" rel="noopener noreferrer">LaserPecker 1 Pro</a> and saw it as a way to start a new business during the pandemic. We’ve always been interested in crafts but decided that the LaserPecker Pro could be a nice way to start something more professional.</p>

<p class=" old-record-id-PwYkdyy0AoAwSkxGWh9cNoYYnnc">We’ve been able to offer products that just wouldn’t be possible without a laser engraver. We have been busy with our normal jobs but are working continuously to get our website and online store ready or orders.</p>

<p data-page-id="Iu2RdpVmvoCEKhxVDwZc7EHbnzf" data-docx-has-block-data="false">We have mainly spent quite a bit of time working on projects locally and putting together our products for our website (www.welaserart.com) that we plan to launch in summer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What products you're working on made by LaserPecker ?</h3>

<p class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-M8widQiM0oas4UxyK8jc4uMUnnc">We’ve been working on a range of different products from charcuterie boards to personalised items. We want to create higher end art pieces as part of our product line, so have been working on some techniques to make our engravings very special.</p>
<p class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-M8widQiM0oas4UxyK8jc4uMUnnc"> </p>
<p class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-NCMMdiIU2oeKcwx643fcps49nXf">We have been working with some local businesses to provide things like coasters, business plates and chopping/charcuterie boards mainly.</p>

<p class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-NCMMdiIU2oeKcwx643fcps49nXf">Our customers have been delighted with the products we’ve made. Even the items we’ve made for friends and family have been well received. I think being able to give someone something that has been personalised shows a lot of thought and care.</p>

<h3>What do you think about your LaserPecker 1 Pro?</h3>
<p>Using it has been really easy. It really is very simple to set up. It does take a little time to perfect the settings for the materials you want to work on but our results have been fantastic. </p>
<p><br>You get professional finishes very easily. The ability to be able to work with any image is amazing. You can really tweak different settings to create different effects and the preview mode included is great for working out the layout on the product you are working on.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Is laser engraving project a good Etsy business? How should you run a business like this? Hope you could learn something from our today's blog post.</p>
<p>Kristen Terrell, owner of LaserPecker 1 and 2 who are based in US and runs an Etsy store(Bluedragonpipes.com). This blog post features our interview with her.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0572/9465/1439/files/Kristen_600x600.jpg?v=1672912290" alt=""></p>
<h3>Can you tell us what inspired you to take laser engraving as your Etsy business?</h3>
<p>I have been a crafting entrepreneur since I was a child. 7 years ago, I was a bit unique in that market as I merge clay and glass to make my pipes. </p>
<p>I am an artist who gets lots of joy out of seeing people appreciate my work but the markets where I can showcase my products were very limited. That, and with a wish to offer a different style of pipe.</p>
<p>I began looking into the possibility of a laser for glass etching. I actually bought two others before the LaserPecker.</p>
<p>I finally found and bought the LaserPecker Pro, and while it doesn’t do glass with the ease I had hoped, it has opened up a whole new realm of crafts and ideas.</p>
<p> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0572/9465/1439/files/Kirsten-blog-story_600x600.png?v=1672913056" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>What do you make and how do you run your business?</h3>
<p>I make signs of all sorts. I’ve made coasters, keychains and much more. I even worked a deal with a couple of vendors at an event I go to weekly so that they can send their customers to me to have engravings on the products they buy from them.</p>
<p>I have added many laser engraved signs and other items both to my etsy store and my flea market booth. I can also now customize items while the customer is shopping.</p>
<p> I now have Instagram and TikTok showcasing time-lapsed videos of the burns. I find these relaxing to watch and hope others do too.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How do you like LasPecker 1 Pro?</h3>
<p>It’s so much easier than the other lasers I’ve tried. I was able to use it within minutes of opening it.</p>
<p>I have had very few problems and the great people on the LaserPecker Facebook group have been fantastic helping when it comes to problems or design queries.</p>
<p>My favorite is the ease in which I can take almost any black and white picture and engrave it.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<div data-page-id="Iu2RdpVmvoCEKhxVDwZc7EHbnzf" data-docx-has-block-data="false">
<p class=" old-record-id-Vewkd2GKSoSMwMxWYidcWDzMnic">There is a small learning process to get a quality product, and there are some tricks that can make the burn that much better but compared to the other lasers it is so much easier to use.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>How's your business now? Do you enjoy it?</h3>
<p> One set of coasters sent the recipient into tears of happiness! Most really like the products. I enjoy making products that bring a smile and frequently hear laughs and giggles as people stop to read my signs.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<div>Today we're having Michael Atkinson from UK for My LaserPecker Story. He's a professional fashion photographer and started his business(wemakeart.uk) after getting <a href="https://bit.ly/3HTgoym" target="_blank" title="LaserPecker 1 pro" rel="noopener noreferrer">LaserPecker 1 pro</a>. Let's see what he says.</div>
<div></div>
<div><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0572/9465/1439/files/Michael_600x600.jpg?v=1672907254" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
<h3></h3>
<h3>What inspired you to have your own business as a photographer?</h3>
<p>I have a varied background as a serial entrepreneur. The laser engraving business arose due to products I would buy as a photographer as gifts and offerings which I thought I could do myself and offer to other photographers and clients.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Then why did you choose LaserPecker for gift offering?</h3>
<p>Having limited space to set up an engraving area, I needed something small, yet effective for my ideas and projects. I did some research online and found some social media groups that showed me there were a lot of desktop lasers that would have worked out but I needed something that could be packed away easily. That’s where the LaserPecker caught my eye.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0572/9465/1439/files/mike-1-blog_600x600.png?v=1672910011" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h3>And what about LaserPecker 1 Pro?</h3>
<p>It was really the LaserPecker Pro’s portability, to be packed away and engrave ideas/projects that was one of the main reasons for choosing it. No other laser I’m aware of can be easily packed away and transported to a client site as easily as the LaserPecker Pro.</p>
<p>I was also amazed that it could be powered from a power bank as I didn’t need to worry about always having to find a power source or worry about cables.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Did it turn out to be as expected?</h3>
<p>Yes! The LaserPecker app is easy and intuitive to use if you don’t try to over complicate what you want to do. For simple text/shapes and already designed images the process to start engraving is nice and quick.</p>
<p><br>The ability to see on screen the effects of each mode and adjustments with sliders makes fine adjustments easy. For more complex and bespoke designs, I use desktop and or other mobile design applications before transferring it to the LaserPecker app for processing and engraving. I love the size of the unit which helps create add-ons which I 3D print for it to help in my projects.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0572/9465/1439/files/mike-blog_600x600.png?v=1672909130" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>So how's your business and how did you find cutsomers?</h3>
<p>My clients are very happy with the products and engravings I have produced and many, repeat orders and pass on additional clients through word of mouth. This happens a lot with my commercial and corporate clients.</p>
<p>Clients find it amazing that engravings can be done at their location rather than having to dismantle and or ship their products.</p>
<h3>What's your future plans for your business?</h3>
<p>Laser engraving has been a great craft to continue to build during the pandemic as a lot of work can be done either at the workshop or at the client site with little or no interaction. My aim is to increase my offerings but remain mobile so as to keep catching a special niche.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>In the blog post, My LaserPecker Story, we'll invite users from all walks of life. Today we're interviewing Bryan Kantor, owner of <a href="http://bit.ly/3HTgoym" target="_blank" title="LaserPecker 1 pro" rel="noopener noreferrer">LaserPecker 1 pro</a>, a charity organizer based in Canada. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0572/9465/1439/files/Bryan_600x600.jpg?v=1672125764" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h3>Can you tell us more about your charity?</h3>
<p>I run a charity called Niagara Cares ( www.niagaracares.org) that we set up this year. Our charity focuses on helping people in our community with issues such as mental health, addiction and homelessness. One of our main goals is to help connect volunteers with groups that are in need of help. We hold various fundraising events to raise money and we are currently organising new events to help when Covid-19 lockdown restrictions lift. Most of our volunteer work has been at a local out of the cold shelter as well as helping Working The Streets Niagara to sort and distribute any donations they receive.</p>
<h3>That's so nice of you! Then how did you get to use LaserPecker?</h3>
<p>I first learned about LaserPecker through Facebook and started to look into it a bit more. We were really interested in it because of the portability and it looked really easy to set up and use!</p>
<h3>Then what happened after you get it?</h3>
<p>I’ve been using the LaserPecker Pro as a way to help raise funds to support the charity work we do at Niagara Cares. We did personal photos engraving for birthday parties and Mother's Day. We thought it would be a great idea for them to remember loved ones.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0572/9465/1439/files/Bryan-Mothers_day_600x600.png?v=1672126950" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h3>We're glad it helped! What do you think of it so far?</h3>
<p>I’ve found the product works great. There was a little bit of a learning curve but wasn’t difficult at all to figure out and was pretty easy. Once you get set up it’s a lot of fun to use. The Preview mode is fantastic. It really helps a lot when lining up photos for engraving.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<div data-page-id="Iu2RdpVmvoCEKhxVDwZc7EHbnzf" data-docx-has-block-data="false">
<div class=" old-record-id-Xq20dqQwAomAuKxYLIAcp2vwnNf">They have all loved the work we’ve made. Especially seeing their photos put on to wood. Most of them have said it looks amazing. One memorial piece we made in particular for a friend was really special. She thought it was beautiful to have those memories to put in her home.</div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0572/9465/1439/files/photos_on_wood_600x600.png?v=1672127662" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h3>Sweet! What are your future plans then?</h3>
<p>In the future, we want to continue doing personal photo engraving and other pieces for people in the Niagara region.</p>
<p>We have even ordered a second LaserPecker Pro to have as backup and help get more work done in a shorter amount of time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Would you give some tips for anyone who's interested in your story?</h3>
<p>Yes, I would. If they have any interest in making things and using a laser to engrave, I’d greatly encourage them to get a LaserPecker. Either it be for fun, hobby or even as an added source of income. And for anyone who who might be interested in helping our charity, we would ask you to contact us on Facebook or via our website www.niagaracares.org.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Engraved pictures indeed make a great, lasting piece for generation memories. Thanks to Bryan, we'd never imagine before this would be so meaningful related to charity organizations. </p>]]>

<p>We wanted to learn about his business, how he works with the materials and what changes LaserPecker brings to his life, so we had an interview for his LaserPecker story.<br><br></p>
<h3>What inspired you to have your own fashion brand as an artist?</h3>
<p>I love to create and fashion has been my outlet! Also if I can produce items that enable me to fund bigger, cool design projects, it's worth it! And it brings me joy when I see people wearing items I've created.</p>
<h3>How did you get to start using laser ethcing method? And what's the difference between 3D printing and lasers for you?</h3>
<p>Using laser etching allows me to take existing materials and quite easily, add my own design, transforming them into something new, where as 3D printing is a lot longer process. Both allow me to create my own design but with the laser, I can create items quick and easy!</p>
